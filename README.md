AVC Team 4 (AVC++)

This is the repository for Team AVC++ for the ENGR 101 Autonomous Vehicle Challenge 2016.

**Week 1 Checklist**
- [x] ALL: Complete AVC plan
- [x] Thomas: Create GitHub repository, ensure essential contact information is obtained
- [x] Jody and Fergus: Write program that will get the robot moving in a straight line
- [x] Liam and Cameron: Begin to construct framework, create a plan

**Week 2 Checklist**
- [ ] ALL: Attend meeting, write report introduction
- [x] Thomas: Organise meeting, making sure to take notes and edit GitHub, also ensure a solid plan is in place for the next lab
- [ ] Liam/Cameron: Complete plan
- [ ] Jody, Cameron and Fergus: Take advantage of break to learn about C++

**Week 3 Checklist**
- [ ] ALL: Complete half of the progress report
- [ ] Thomas: Ascertain progress to gauge what needs to be done the following week and assist wherever possible
- [ ] Jody, Cameron and Fergus: program the first quadrant (work together on 1 computer, focus on following the line then opening the gate)
- [ ] Liam and Cameron: Utilise plan to build robot (CAD and paper design)

**Week 2 Meeting - 27/4/16 3pm**
In attendence: Thomas, Jody, Fergus, Liam, Cameron (everyone)
We had a meeting over Skype to discuss our progress thus far and to establish a plan for lab time in week 3.

We looked over the kaiwhata wiki together to help us get a general idea of a few things, then we moved onto discussing the general week 3 goal and revising individual roles. Our goal for week 3 is to complete quadrant 1, which involves following a straight white line and passing through a gate we need to wirelessly open. We decided Cameron and Liam would focus on hardware, while Jody and Cameron would work together on 1 computer to write the code, focusing on following the line, testing it, then worrying about the gate. Thomas will have his attention split between both aspects, but mostly focusing on the helping with the code.

In addition, we dicussed reminders along with our progress, and it appears everyone is well on their way to completing their week 2 goals.
